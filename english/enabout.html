		<h2>Peter Lettenbichler</h2>
        <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: baseline;">
            <p>
                Hello, I am Peter Lettenbichler, 19 years old and a Fullstack Software Engineer. <br>
                My frontend skills are still developing, so I focus more on backend development. 
                Below you can see my top 5 programming languages. Additionally, I know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XAML,
                QML, and Powerscript. These are not as important to me because most of them are not full programming languages or are just for UI design.
            </p>

			Skills (sorted by experience) 
			<br>
            <ul>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
                    C#: I started programming with C# and have written several complex applications. 
                    In my applications, I learned how to interact with the Windows Registry, manipulate databases, 
                    create installers, manage settings, create files, and handle file operations.
                </li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
                    SQL: At work, I use SQL extensively and design databases. 
                    There's not much to say about SQL; I use standard commands daily, and occasionally a UNION ALL. 
                    I mostly work with joins, group by, and cases.
                </li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
                    C++: C++ quickly became a favorite. C# holds my hand and prevents certain errors, 
                    which was welcome at first, but I soon felt constrained. 
                    With C++, I handle manual garbage collection, memory leaks, and file handling errors, which I find satisfying. 
                    Unlike C#, C++ lets me make mistakes and learn from them. 
                    I place a high value on performance because, as a child/teenager, 
                    I never had the latest hardware, and C++ helps me write resource-efficient programs.
                </li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
                    BASIC: Not Visual Basic, but BASIC. To better understand the relationship between hardware and software, I learned BASIC.
                    The idea was that the people who brought the first commercial computers to market 
                    didn't have much choice of languages. 
                    I learned BASIC using <a href="http://www.quitebasic.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #008800;">this</a> BASIC interpreter.
                </li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
                    Assembly: For fun and a better understanding, I started learning Assembly. 
                    Assembly is the lowest level programming language, and that's exactly why it fascinates me. 
                    I'm also writing an OS in Assembly, though most of it is outsourced to C.
