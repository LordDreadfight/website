			I know the website could look better, but I'm OK with how it looks right now. Bjarne Stroustrup's (the inventor of C++)
			website(<a href="https://stroustrup.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #008800;">stroustrup.com</a>) looks like this, so I can leave mine like this too.

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			In my passion for programming, I have successfully completed various projects. <br>
			One of my works is a C++-based Android app that enhances productivity and optimizes processes for end-users.
			By using C++, I developed a powerful and user-friendly application that runs smoothly on mobile devices. <br>
			Furthermore, I created my own website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my programming skills and projects. <br>
			As an avid database expert, I developed a SQL console in C# that simplifies database queries and optimizes performance.
			A notable feature of this console is the ability to export the retrieved tables to a .xlsx file, making the data accessible for further analysis and reports.
			It also allows exporting the SQL command to a text file to facilitate archiving of already written commands. <br>
			In addition, I created a C# application that helps seamlessly switch ODBC database connections.
			This application allows users to quickly and easily navigate between different databases without having to perform cumbersome configurations. <br>
		</p>
		<h2>Tools (for Programming)</h2>
		<p>
			These are the tools I use for programming my projects:
			<ul>
				<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
					Visual Studio: is my go-to for C# applications. I use Visual Studio for projects (mostly desktop) where performance is secondary. <br>
					It is very "beginner-friendly", I use it when I need a fully functional program in a few minutes.
				</li>
				<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
					Visual Studio Code: I'm currently using it to write this website and an entire operating system.
				</li>
				<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
					QT-Creator Community: with QT I write my C++ mobile applications and
					desktop applications where performance is important. With QT I mainly write C++ and QML,
					QML is a UI-designer language at its core similar to XAML in Microsoft WPF programs.
				</li>
				<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
					SQL-Console: this is the program I developed and use to write my SQL selects. It has code highlighting and you can write selects and save their datasets in a .xlsx file.
				</li>
			</ul>
