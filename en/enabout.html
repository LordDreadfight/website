		<h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>
                Hi, I'm Peter, 20 years old, and a Fullstack Software Engineer. <br>
                My frontend skills are still improving, so I focus more on backend. 
                Below you can find the 5 programming languages I know. Additionally, I am familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XAML,
                QML, and PowerScript. However, these are not as important to me because most of them are not full programming languages / 
                are mainly for UI design.
            </p>

			Skills (sorted by experience) 
			<br>
            <ul>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
                    C#: I started programming with C# and have written several complex applications. 
                    In my applications, I learned how to interact with the Windows Registry, manipulate databases, create installers, 
                    manage settings, handle file creation, and file handling.
                </li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
                    SQL: At my company, I work a lot with SQL and database design. There's not much to say about SQL—standard commands are in daily use, and the occasional
                    `UNION ALL` crosses my path. I mostly work with `joins`, `group by`, and `case` statements.
                </li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;" >
                    C++: I immediately fell in love with C++. C# holds your hand and prevents certain mistakes, which was very welcome at first,
                    but I soon felt confined. C++ allows manual garbage collection, memory leaks, and file handling errors—and I’m completely fine with that. 
                    Unlike C#, C++ lets me make mistakes and learn from them. I also place a high value on performance in programs because, as a child/teenager, 
                    I never had the latest hardware, and C++ helps a lot in writing resource-efficient programs.
                </li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;" >
                    C: Any web developer who thinks that C is outdated or a dying language in today's world doesn't know what they're talking about. 
                    I started learning C to better understand the roots of C++ and why things are the way they are. Since I already liked C++, 
                    it's no surprise that I also enjoy C. The simplicity adds to the charm of the language, with a quote from Bjarne Stroustrup being quite fitting:
                    "C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but when you do it blows your whole leg off." I like C so much 
                    because it's essentially a blank canvas where you can experiment and test, just to make the code 12 milliseconds faster than it was before.
                </li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
                    BASIC: Not Visual Basic, but BASIC. To better understand the relationship between hardware and software, I learned BASIC. 
                    The idea was that the people who brought the first commercial computers to the market didn't have many language choices at the time. 
                    I learned BASIC with <a href="http://www.quitebasic.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #008800;">this</a> BASIC interpreter.
                </li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
                    Assembly: For fun and for better understanding, I started learning Assembly. 
                    Assembly is the lowest-level programming language that exists, and it's for this reason that it fascinates me so much. 
                    I'm also writing an OS in Assembly, but most of it is offloaded to C.
