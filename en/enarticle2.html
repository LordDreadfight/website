        <h1>My Laptop</h1>
        <h5>My self-built laptop and its abrupt demise, from 06.10.2024</h5>
        <p>
            Hello, this post is about my DIY laptop that I built myself.
            As some of you may know, a power bank deflagrated in my room in June (Deflagration describes a combustion process that is too slow for an explosion and too fast for a regular fire).
            Everything that was on my desk was destroyed either by the flames or by the ABC powder from the fire extinguisher. This included my PC, 2 of my 3 monitors, and also my laptop. Here’s a picture:

            <img src="../rss/img/laptopueberrestechassis.jpg" alt="broken laptop chassis" style="width: 100%;">
            These are the remains of my laptop. The laptop burned down less than 2 weeks after completion. :c. This laptop was over 3 years in the making and cost me countless sleepless nights.
            I won’t talk about the actual price of the laptop right now, but it was in the 4-figure range, and it hurts just to think about it. This is what the laptop looked like when it was finished:
            <img src="../rss/img/laptopglory.jpg" alt="laptop in its finished state. the case is 3D printed and 100% DIY" style="width: 100%;">
            The laptop was 100% DIY. It had an SBC with an N100 CPU, 16GB RAM, a 1TB SSD, and a gorgeous FHD 13.3-inch IPS display with colors so beautiful that OLED displays would be envious.
            Of course, the specs are weak for a laptop that cost me €1500, but I spent several hundred hours designing, printing, redesigning, soldering, and wiring the laptop.
            As I said, a how-to is coming soon, and to conclude, I’d like to share a few more pictures of the laptop.
